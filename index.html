        <h2>What we do</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          We work hands-on with founders to stabilise and scale the operational core of the business.
          The focus is always practical delivery, not slideware or theory.
        </p>

          <div class="callout">
            <h3>Operating cadence and execution</h3>
            <p>
              We help establish clear ownership, decision-making, and planning rhythms so work moves forward
              predictably. This includes lightweight goal setting, prioritisation, and follow-through that
              founders and teams actually use.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="callout">
            <h3>Process and automation</h3>
            <p>
              We simplify and improve core operational processes, then automate the parts that should not
              require human effort. The goal is to reduce busywork, remove friction, and free up time for
              higher-value work.

          <div class="callout">
            <h3>Governance and readiness</h3>
            <p>
              We put in place the controls and operating discipline needed to scale responsibly. This might
              include compliance readiness, security posture, documentation, and clear operational guardrails
              without introducing unnecessary bureaucracy.

          <div class="callout">
            <h3>Customer flow and delivery</h3>
            <p>
              We look end-to-end at how customers move through onboarding, delivery, renewal, and support.
              Improvements here are usually the fastest way to unlock growth without hiring.

        <h2>How we work</h2>

        <div class="prose">
          <p>We work as embedded operators, not external advisors.</p>

          <p>
            That means we spend time in the detail, take responsibility for outcomes, and help founders turn intent into execution.
            We are comfortable working in ambiguity, making trade-offs, and moving quickly when things are imperfect.
          </p>

          <p>
            Engagements are typically fractional and time-bound. We focus on building systems and capability that last beyond our involvement,
            rather than creating dependency.
          </p>

          <p>We work best with founders who want:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clarity over complexity</li>
            <li>Momentum over perfection</li>
            <li>Calm execution during periods of growth or change</li>
